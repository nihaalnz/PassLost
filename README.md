# PassLost

A simple password manager that use AES 256 to encrypt and store passwords locally. The password is NOT visible to an outside AT ALL. Simple interface, using tkinter.

To run the app, clone this repository and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. 

Create a new database and give it a master password, then add data onto the database. Right click and choose copy to copy the password to your clipboard.

Next time just open the created database and enter the master password and voila.

Still in the _beta_ version and undergoing testing.
